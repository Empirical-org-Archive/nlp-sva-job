# Porcupine

A minimal website that uses Quill.org's subject-verb agreement (SVA) model to give useful feedback on
subject-verb agreement errors.

Porcupine is meant to demonstrate the model's functionality.  You can use and
modify it, or play with it to see if Quill's SVA model is right for your application.


## Getting started

Install the project requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server
```bash
python app.py
```

Hit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to ensure it is running.

Have fun.

## Please Note:

Quill's SVA model is still under rapid development and feedback may not always be
accurate. Please remember this when deciding whether to use it.
