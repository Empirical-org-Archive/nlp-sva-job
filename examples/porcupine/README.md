# Porcupine

A minimal website that uses Quill.org's QFragment to give useful feedback on
sentences and sentence fragments.

Porcupine is meant to demonstrate QFragment's functionality.  You can use and
modify it, or play with it to see if QFragment is right for your application.


## Getting started

Install the project requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server
```bash
python app.py
```

Hit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to ensure it is running.

Have fun.

## Please Note:

QFragment is still under rapid development and feedback may not always be
accurate. Please remember this when deciding whether to use it.
